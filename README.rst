sphinxcontrib.doxylinks
=======================

`Sphinx`__ extension to save typing when linking to some information
contained in a `Doxygen`__ documentation.

.. __: http://sphinx-doc.org/
.. __: http://www.doxygen.org/


Installation
------------

Download the latest version of the code from GitHub:
https://github.com/fpoirotte/sphinxcontrib-doxylinks/archive/master.tar.gz

Extract the contents of the archive and go into the newly created directory.

Then, install the extension from the machine's root account::

    root@localhost:~# python setup.py install


Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages must be installed on your machine for this extension
to work:

-   python (2.6.x or 2.7.x).
    The code has not been tested under Python 3.x.y yet.
-   python-sphinx (1.0.7 or later)
-   python-libxml2 (2.8.0 is known to work, others probably work too)

You will also need a Doxygen tagfile for the project you want to link to.
Such a tagfile can be generated by setting the option ``GENERATE_TAGFILE``
in your Doxyfile to the path where you want the file to be generated
and then running doxygen.


How to use
----------

First, load the extension in your ``conf.py``::

    extensions = [
        'sphinxcontrib.doxylinks',
        # other extensions...
    ]

This extension adds two new config values.
The first one is called ``doxylinks`` and is created like this::

    doxylinks = {'exmpl': ('http://example.com/', '/path/to/tagfile'), ...}

The second one is called ``doxylinks_cache_limit`` and indicates
the number of days a remote tagfile will be kept in cache before
being considered invalid (which will cause it to be fetched again
the next time ``sphinx-build`` is run).
The default value is 1, meaning that remote tagfiles will only be
fetched once per day. Set the value to 0 to disable caching entirely.

Now you can use e.g. :exmpl:`foo` in your documents.  This will create a
link to the page at ``http://example.com/`` containing the documentation
about the symbol named ``foo``.
The link caption will be the symbol's name, unless an explicit caption
is given, e.g. :exmpl:`Foo <foo>`.

The full path to the symbol is retrieved from the Doxygen tagfile located
at ``/path/to/tagfile``, which can be either a local file or an URL
to some online file.

If `add_function_parentheses`__ is set to ``True`` in your ``conf.py``
and if no explicit caption was given, the symbol will be suffixed
with a set of parentheses whenever this is appropriate.

The following objects can currently be referenced:

-   Custom pages (e.g. :exmpl:`My_custom_page`).
-   Classes (e.g. :exmpl:`MyClass`).
-   Interfaces (e.g. :exmpl:`MyInterface`).
-   Class methods (e.g. :exmpl:`MyClass::MyMethod`).
-   Class constants (e.g. :exmpl:`MyClass::MY_CONSTANT`).
-   Class variables (e.g. :exmpl:`MyClass::MyVariable`).
    For languages that prefix variables (e.g. PHP), the prefix must also
    be included (e.g. :exmpl:`MyClass::$_myVariable`).
